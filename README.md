# Nexo API tests

I was not able to find a public API for Google's price conversions, so I used Binance's API.

To run the tests and generate results, execute `npm test`. The results will be saved under the `/reports` directory.

If you are experiencing environment issues, I have also created a Docker container for it. Simply run `dockerisedRun.sh` and the test report will be opened in Chrome after the test run finishes.
